# Christianity Apologetics FAQ

**Q: Why is there evil and suffering, even though God is willing and able to eliminate them?**

**A:** We do not know and we do not have the qualifications to know. Let God be God, in His full holiness and glorious wisdom. Are you God? Read the book of Job in the Bible (God’s answer to this question). Deuteronomy 29:29. God does not want robots (humans are equipped with free will from the very beginning of Adam and Eve – created in God’s image). Free-will argument.

**Q: Do science and religion contradict or support (or even coincide with) each other?**

**A:** They support each other. Both are faith-based (we have faith in something or someone -> fundamental belief; natural tendency). Examples: believing that a chair would hold our weight, a baby believing that his/her parents would take good care of him/her, etc. In science, we put faith in our instruments, ability to measure, precision and accuracy, theories to make sense of this world, etc. We seek understanding and question hypotheses in both fields, exploring the world to find the answers to the questions that we have/pose. There are experts that would help us as well.

**Q: What is wrong with atheism? How do we know that God really exists?**

**A:** Humanity is created to worship. Anyone would worship something or someone (whatever it is), making it their own god (or God). Also, there is a lot of evidence pointing to the existence of God and we should pursue to understand all of these. However, Christians should not "judge" (and then discriminate, treat poorly, etc.) those who decide to be an atheist or an agnostic. Again, just to serve as a gentle reminder, we are called to love others. Show people what true unconditional love is, even when the situation is unsustainably hard or when the conditions are difficult. Treat humans humanely, with some form of humanity. The decision is intrinsically mutual (by its very nature); how you treat others is an instruction book for others on how to treat you. And Christians are called to go above and beyond this decision; to love others even when they do not love us back.

**Q: How do we know that Jesus really lived?**

**A:**
  - The vast majority of scholars think that Jesus really lived (deep disbelief is by far a minority position – Luke’s investigation and Luke was not a disciple of Jesus Christ, Jesus is ranked 1st biggest person).
  - Non-Christian sources attest to Jesus as well (11 ancient references -> firm and credible evidence, gets the name, place, time and title right).
  - The New Testament is early and thus, reliable (Jesus Christ: Mark – 20 years, Matthew – 50 years, Luke – 40 years, John – 60 years; vs Emperor Tiberius: Tacitus – 80 years; vs Alexander the Great: Polybius – 120 years, Arrian – 400 years).
  - The New Testament is a collection of sources and thus, reliable (4 Gospel accounts + 23 Epistles -> multiple sources, witnesses & criterion of multiple attestation fulfilled; independent and non-biased).
  - Archaeology supports the Gospels (Galilee was Jewish – ritual baths, burial boxes, limestone bowls, and rubbish; inscription: Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judea – dated to 26-36 A.D. <-> Luke 3:1 which is 30-31 A.D., notice the accuracy; The Dead Sea Scrolls – 1961, dated to 30 A.D., oldest manuscripts, have 99.7% R<sup>2</sup> value of accuracy).

**Q: How do we know that Jesus really died?**

**A:**
  - Recorded by Tacitus (a Roman senator).
  - Romans really know how to kill (John 19:34).

**Q: How do we know that Jesus really resurrected?**

**A:**
  - All 12 of Jesus’ disciples transformed.
  - Jesus predicted His death and resurrection in detail (exact fashion).
  - Can 12 men keep a lie for 40 years, not once departing from it, holding that lie even under beatings, flogging, torture, and even ultimately death? (only John was not martyred, the rest of the apostles were).

**Q: How can we know that the Bible is fully reliable?**

**A:**
  - Canonization.
  - Extreme-level of similarity between archaeological evidences (only 4 trivial types of differences -> different multiple sources and translations: 97% differences are in spelling, grammar and active-passive tone, the rest are reconcilable, no dilemmas - listen to one of the sermons of Breakaway Ministries audio recording for an in-depth analysis and exposition on it) – reliability confirmed.

**Q: Why are there Christians that still do evil actions?**

**A:** Christians are still humans and even though they believe and trust in a perfect God, they are still imperfect. We all will still be tempted by our carnal desires and our sinful nature in this world, Christian or not. Justification -> sanctification -> glorification. This, however, do not give us a license/permission to sin anyway we like. We aim for perfection in Christ by God’s grace alone (even though we will never achieve it in this physical world). Some ‘Christians’ may not be true Christians in their hearts (they may just call themselves ‘Christians’, making it just as a label for their ID religion).

**Q: Is there an absolute truth?**

**A:** Yes, it is God’s Word (Bible -> commandments, comments, etc.) It is used to differentiate between the right and the wrong.

**Q: Are we not allowed to judge?**

**A:** If we are not allowed to judge, then why do you judge me for judging? God is the only wise, just and rightful judge. We are supposed to give constructive feedbacks to each other while not putting them down, building each other’s faith.

**Q: Are we not allowed to lie?**

**A:** We are not allowed to give false witnesses. While we should tell the truth as often as possible, giving a false witness is actually different from lying.

**Q: Do Heaven and Hell exist and what are they?**

**A:** Hell exists and it is just a place where there is no presence of God at all (no goodness, etc.) -> that means in this physical world, there is still God’s presence. God gives us a free choice, whether to accept Him or not, if yes then we will be in Heaven, which is just a place full of God’s presence and holiness and love. Hell is a place of punishment for Lucifer (Satan, the Devil), and he does not punish humans there (not mentioned in the Bible).

**Q: Does God really love us?**

**A:** God does not tolerate, yet God loves. God does not force (love does not force -> someone who forces you to be a friend to them is not a real friend). God hates sin and loves people.

**Q: What is salvation and how does it work?**

**A:** Our salvation is entirely dependent on God’s grace: by grace through faith – not cheap grace, but free gift (God does not only forgive our past sins -> He forgives all sins; even new creations still do sins and mistakes). It is not cheap as God sacrificed and has given His only Son. We are not saved because we are capable of maintaining our salvation. If people believe that salvation is by works, then it can be lost (on-off). But the truth is, that salvation is by grace – it cannot be lost. Ephesians 2:8-9. Trust the Bible more than trust the pastors (not tragic).

**Q: Can true Christians be affected by spiritual transfer?**

**A:** Ephesians 1:13, Ephesians 4:30. We are sealed by the Holy Spirit until the Day of Redemption (Rapture). Spiritual transfer is impossible as Holy Spirit is stronger than any other spirits. Anointment is real (it is not a spiritual transfer). Like in Indonesia (welcome!), where there are still a lot going on with the dark spiritual side (santet, dukun, ganda uang, etc.) at Trenggalek, Banyuwangi, Jogjakarta, Tulungagung, etc.

**Q: If Jesus was tied by white paper (like a mummy), should Christians follow that example?**

**A:** Jesus was put in a cave, so must the dead body of Christians be put in a cave? We just need to follow the customs, policies and regulations of each of the government. We respect the authority of the government. Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan do not have enough landmass to bury people, so the corpses must be burnt. And we follow that, but it does not mean that those burnt are cursed. Culture does not affect salvation. Physical body is just a vessel in this world for our spirit & soul.

**Q: Will those who share the Gospel and save souls (not acquire) get different crowns in Heaven compared to those who do not?**

**A:** 1 Thessalonians 2:19. Paul got the crown of joy. We have been saved by God -> we would do anything for Him, yet God provided multiple crowns in Heaven (crown of joy for those who save souls – make God happy as souls are treasures of God). We are only saved by grace, even though we do not do anything (like those who believe in God mere moments before death). God is not a communist as He is just (collect your treasures in Heaven). Grace & truth. It’s not have to, but love to. Heaven -> Kingdom form (not communism form); not a slave mentality -> we do not chase the rewards of working for God; we do it because we love God (Bible says that there are rewards for those who work for God). There are differences in authority in Heaven (given to different individuals). We want explanations of Heaven with the glasses of men. We must see information critically.

**Q: What is the importance of Rapture?**

**A:** Rapture is to preserve the body of Christ (God’s bride; the Church) from the tribulations of the Antichrist age on Earth. The timeline of the Bible. 

**Q: How to comfort those who are grieving of/for the death of someone?**

**A:** 1 Thessalonians 4:13. Speak wisely, especially in circumstances where the person who passed away did not accept Christ (willingly and knowingly or not).

**Q: What did Jesus mean when He said that God’s kingdom is near in the Bible?**

**A:** When Jesus said that the Kingdom of God is close, He was talking about Himself as God of Kingdom of Israel – but He was rejected by Israel, hence salvation is given to non-Israelites (given time of about 2000 years by God). If Israel accepted Jesus, God’s Kingdom (Heaven) will instantly be here on Earth and through Israel, God will bless all the nations. But the reality was not like that. Matthew 8:12. Jacob’s trouble. Jesus was talking very harshly -> before Jesus’ death, it is by grace & works, while after Jesus’ death, it is by grace only (rightly dividing the Bible to understand who God is and what He wants for us). Ephesians 2:7,11. Jesus came to fulfill Lord Yahweh’s promise with Abraham (Israel). The past is the past, the present is the present, the future is the future. Amputations; Bible study. Giving and faith. God obtained this world by giving His only Son, and we received it by faith. We win the world by giving love/Jesus as well as by faith (also). Romans 8:28, Jeremiah 29:11, Psalms 23.

**Q: Where are we now in the Bible?**

**A:** We are in the Philemon stage of the Bible (2017).

**Q: Isn’t the claim that Jesus is the only way to God a little too arrogant?**

**A:** If evidence-wise, Christianity is the most supported, then it is not arrogant. That's how science works as well; we choose the most correct theory based on our experimental observations.

**Q: Aren’t all religions the same?**

**A:** It is not about religion. It is about a relationship. Christianity is a relationship, where God seeks us (and definitely succeeded), compared to other religions where humans try to seek God (and failed). Evidence-wise, Christianity is supported by archaeology and historical literature, even from records outside the Bible.

**Q: Is there more to life than this?**

**A:** Yes, of course. That's what the Bible is for. Basic instructions before leaving Earth. It's for both the present life and the life to come.

**Q: What happens after I die?**

**A:** This is one of the 4 questions of life:
  - Who are you?
  -	Why are you here?
  -	How do you differentiate the good from the bad?
  -	What happens to you (in the afterlife, if you believe that there is any at all) after you die?
Body is just a temporary housing. Death is just a temporary separation. Lifestyle, lifespan and healthspan. Yet, death is a point of no return (no more chances or opportunities to turn back/change final decision of wanting to be with God and believe in Jesus or not).

**Q: If God loves humans, why did He drive Adam and Eve away from the Garden of Eden?**

**A:** Because God loves them and us, He drove Adam and Eve away from the Garden of Eden. He even provided clothing for them. There are 2 special trees in Eden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. God only did not allow Adam and Eve from eating the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (ask yourself why is this?). Once Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil (thereby being against God and hence becoming evil – ‘dead’, even though not by self but by being affected and tempted by Satan so that is why there is still possibility of salvation for humans, unlike Satan in essence from himself), God drove Adam and Eve away from the Garden of Eden because if they eat the fruit from the Tree of Life, they will become ‘dead’ forever – no chance of salvation (versus eating only from the Tree of Life meaning being alive forever for both of them and all of their descendants).

**Q: If God loves humanity, why did He put the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the garden?**

**A:** As humans were created in the image of God, by virtue of the fact that we have the freedom to choose, we must (by principle/essence) be given the opportunity to choose between good and evil, between right and wrong.

**Q: Are Christians against abortion?**

**A:** The usual argument of the sanctity of life applies here, but let's explore deeper with an anecdote. Let's say that a poor woman who currently has two children becomes pregnant. Let's say that she is offered the option of abortion since she might not have the resources necessary to take care of her third child properly. Then, why don't the woman kill her first or second child instead? If you feel that there is a difference, then what is the difference? There is a reason why "killing the first or second child" is not even considered an option, right? If the difference is that the first or second child is alive, then the third unborn child is also considered alive (passes the Nutrition, Environment and Time test). If we say that abortion kills the fetus, that means the fetus was alive in the first place. Further question to ponder upon: if "killing the first or second child" is not up to debate, why is abortion debatable in the first place? Is the issue more about whether we can be assured that a fetus is considered to be alive or not? Or is it something else? Why do humans have to debate about it in the first place? Is there a reason why our moral compass is perturbed when abortion is mentioned? Try to use the Socratic Method when exploring these questions.

**Q: Are Christians against euthanasia or legal physician-assisted suicide?**

**A:** Again, the argument of the sanctity of life. Also, let's frame it this way. Suicide devalues human life. Even without formal religions in mind, we know that killing is inherently wrong. When someone tries to commit suicide, why do people feel disturbed and empathize with them? Why do we try to encourage the person to continue to live, to see the positive aspects of life, to be there with them? Why does the maid panic when the mistress cuts herself with a knife in the kitchen in the middle of the night? Inspect that sudden fight-or-flight response. Furthermore, the limits of euthanasia will gradually erode if it is allowed (slippery slope). The healthcare system was established in order to cure diseases, or at the very least, alleviate pain. To heal, not to harm, even if it is against the patient's will (complications arise when the patient is mentally not sound -> check the "Ulysses pact"). Manipulating the system to allow euthanasia would violate the physician's integrity and undermine the patient's trust in the healthcare system in the first place. The whole purpose of current research and development in the healthcare sector is to allow us to cure previously-incurable diseases (like cancer) and alleviate more pain. If not, then why do we do all these research and development?

**Q: Are Christians against the LGBTQIADPNCO+ community (homosexuality and more)?**

**A:** Both the Christian community and the LGBT+ community actually have more in common than they think. Prejudice and discrimination from conventional and conservative communities are mostly responsible for the hatred between the two communities. As Christians, we are called to "love thy neighbour as thyself". What part of this calling is not understood? And the LGBT+ community themselves, which is supposed to advocate for equal human rights regardless of sexual identity or sexual orientation, should not vehemently and violently discriminate against other people who, at a first glance, seem to be "less lovable" as well. We should not stand on the side of hatred. We should stand on the side of love. Regarding the sexual orientation issue itself, it is a question of design versus choice. Marriage and sex are supposed to be beautiful, the ultimate pinnacle of the expression of love between two individuals who have become one. God's original design dictates that the best relationship can be forged between a man and a woman. If some people choose to not follow the original blueprints, it is their choice (and we should still love and respect them as human beings, not any less). It is just not in alignment with the original design that God intended it to be. And there are more "choices" that play a stronger role in someone's eventual sexual orientation (even though it might change later in life) rather than just "being born with it", although this in itself is arguable. You can also study Bruce Bagemihl's 1999 book _Biological Exuberance_, an interesting read which outlined examples of homosexual behavior among animals. For those reading this: remember, don't use or cite this as an excuse to judge other people. Ultimately, true unconditional love still prevails. And it never fails. Even above and beyond the so-called conventional concepts of "good" and "evil".
