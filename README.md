### Christianity Apologetics FAQ

This repository will house a Christianity Apologetics FAQ living document. The intention is to share the knowledge about Christianity Apologetics to the public.

This information is usually put behind workshops, meetings, conferences, seminars, commercial books, etc. However, I feel that everyone should be able to acquire (at least some of) this knowledge freely.

## DISCLAIMER
I believe that this document is severely incomplete. Information contained in this document might not be 100% accurate (due to the sheer fact that I am an imperfect human who can make mistakes). Do issue a pull request if you would like to help me add new content to the document. Please consult with a Christian pastor for further clarification and assistance. This document should be used as an auxiliary for your own research, not as the Bible. If you are interested, please explore more on your own accord (maybe grab a Christian friend or two in your journey). I will continue to update (and hopefully improve) this as I collect more accurate information.

## TODO:
1. Categorize FAQ into several clear divisions for easier browsing and access.
